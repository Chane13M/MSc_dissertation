% This file is the configuration file for K600 data. It should take the form of the global definitions at the top:
% ADCModules
% TDCModules
% NumberOfMMM/W1s
% Then, after that lot, the channel definitions for each detector which should be in the form:
% MMMADCChannels
% 1	FirstChannel	LastChannel
% 2	FirstChannel	LastChannel
%.
%.
%.
% n	FirstChannel	LastChannel
% MMMADCChannels

% This should be repeated for all detectors (any detector not defined like this will be ignored.
% Then:
% MMMTDCChannels
% 1	FirstChannel	LastChannel etc.
%
% This should be repeated for all types of detector in the system. If a new type of ancillary detector system is added, the person doing that needs to add the information about how the configuration file should be read in in ReadConfiguration in Parameters.c

% File for calibration stuff - should be of the form: channel offset gain
% Now, if the calibration shouldn't be set, change the file name to 'ignore'
% The calibration file should terminate with a line reading eof
CalibrationFile	calib.dat

% Last line should be ConfigEnd so that the code knows that you're all done
