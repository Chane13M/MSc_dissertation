Analysis code for K600 experiments.

It is a copy of what was in the SetupDev branch, after which
I added and updated some subroutines in f-plane.c to follow
latest improvements in position determination as used
in my personal code for PR226 analysis.

I also started to clean up the code a bit: deleted sections
that are commented out (for past couple of years) and sections
that were originally used for ancilliary detectors, but which
are now obsolete.

More cleanup will follow
